1239907845719691265 2020-03-17 13:34:01 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials. Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS
1239906156463652868 2020-03-17 13:27:18 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Failing  Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!
1239889767267008512 2020-03-17 12:22:11 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Cuomo wants “all states to be treated the same.” But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big “hotspot”, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it....
1239755298811908096 2020-03-17 03:27:51 UTC <realDonaldTrump> The “Times” is a disgrace to journalism! https://twitter.com/mattwolking/status/1239716039518294016 …
1239753277358686209 2020-03-17 03:19:49 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Great news Lindsey! https://twitter.com/lindseygrahamsc/status/1239361193992732673 …
1239685852093169664 2020-03-16 22:51:54 UTC <realDonaldTrump> The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!
1239650086491230209 2020-03-16 20:29:46 UTC <realDonaldTrump> I ask all Americans to band together and support your neighbors by not hoarding unnecessary amounts of food and essentials. TOGETHER we will stay STRONG and overcome this challenge!
1239650018832891905 2020-03-16 20:29:30 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Yesterday I spoke with the great American Grocers and Supply Chain Executives. We are confident that supply will continue to meet demand nationwide. These beacons of our community will remain open for you, no matter what. We are working hard to remove any barriers to that effort!

1239620630523322368 2020-03-16 18:32:44 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Just had a  very good tele-conference with Nation’s Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to “do more”.
1239567267312152576 2020-03-16 15:00:41 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Everybody is so well unified and working so hard. It is a beautiful thing to see. They love our great Country. We will end up being stronger than ever before!
1239532209427623936 2020-03-16 12:41:22 UTC <realDonaldTrump> God Bless the USA!

1239383648018804739 2020-03-16 02:51:02 UTC <realDonaldTrump> I must say, that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. That’s what they ALL said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting, but they will. Be careful!
1239323762987851778 2020-03-15 22:53:05 UTC <realDonaldTrump> The individual Governors of States, and local officials, must step up their efforts on drive up testing and testing sights, working in conjunction with @CDCgov and the Federal Government!
1239252169150410752 2020-03-15 18:08:35 UTC <realDonaldTrump> The Fake and Corrupt News never called Google. They said this was not true. Even in times such as these, they are not truthful. Watch for their apology, it won’t happen. More importantly, thank you to Google! https://twitter.com/google_comms/status/1238989156610707456 …
1239242219019735042 2020-03-15 17:29:03 UTC <realDonaldTrump> So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has “lost” the records of General Michael Flynn. How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!
1239237382458806277 2020-03-15 17:09:50 UTC <realDonaldTrump> Can’t believe they are not going after Schumer for the threats he made to our cherished United States Supreme Court, and our two great Justices. If a Republican did that, there would be an endless price to pay. Pathetic!
1239235411463020544 2020-03-15 17:02:00 UTC <realDonaldTrump> ....The USA was never set up for this, just look at the catastrophe of the H1N1 Swine Flu (Biden in charge, 17,000 people lost, very late response time), but it soon will be. Great decision to close our China, and other, borders early. Saved many lives!
