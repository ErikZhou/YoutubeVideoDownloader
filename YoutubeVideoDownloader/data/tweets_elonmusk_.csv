1239783440704208896 2020-03-17 05:19:40 UTC <elonmusk> Pretty close. Design is evolving rapidly. Would be great to flatten domes, embed engines & add ~1.5 barrel sections of propellant for same total length. Also, current legs are a bit too small.
1239776019856461824 2020-03-17 04:50:11 UTC <elonmusk> Hydroxychloroquine probably better  https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=vE4_LsftNKM¬†‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/wQODHiFeWT
1239757764047429633 2020-03-17 03:37:39 UTC <elonmusk> Sounds sensible
1239756900255903744 2020-03-17 03:34:13 UTC <elonmusk> That said, danger of panic still far exceeds danger of corona imo. If we over-allocate medical resources to corona, it will come at expense of treating other illnesses.

1239755145233289217 2020-03-17 03:27:14 UTC <elonmusk> This paper matches what I‚Äôm hearing from a lot of smart people  https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/988648/COVID-19-Drug-Therapy_Mar-2020.pdf¬†‚Ä¶
1239736953412739074 2020-03-17 02:14:57 UTC <elonmusk> Yeah. Fate loves irony.
1239674538373320706 2020-03-16 22:06:56 UTC <elonmusk> What‚Äôs worse is that I even told Stanford to check me for the $^#* parasite & they still couldn‚Äôt find it!
1239670230567268353 2020-03-16 21:49:49 UTC <elonmusk> Yeah  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum¬†‚Ä¶
1239667765637758983 2020-03-16 21:40:01 UTC <elonmusk> I was first misdiagnosed at Stanford Hospital with viral meningitis, then again misdiagnosed at Sequoia. A visiting doc from San Jose General saw my charts & sent me to ICU immediately. I was ~36 hours from being unrecoverable. So, I take expert advice with a grain of salt ‚Ä¶
1239659857030066178 2020-03-16 21:08:36 UTC <elonmusk> Was also given a lot of doxycycline  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxycycline¬†‚Ä¶
1239654995647254535 2020-03-16 20:49:17 UTC <elonmusk> Maybe helpful
1239652601702080513 2020-03-16 20:39:46 UTC <elonmusk> Yes, I received chloroquine via central line through my chest & both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Would‚Äôve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn‚Äôt mean it works for C19, but maybe better than nothing.
1239650597906898947 2020-03-16 20:31:48 UTC <elonmusk> Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19  https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTi-g18ftNZUMRAj2SwRPodtscFio7bJ7GdNgbJAGbdfF67WuRJB3ZsidgpidB2eocFHAVjIL-7deJ7/pub¬†‚Ä¶

1239598329274798085 2020-03-16 17:04:06 UTC <elonmusk> Slight booster length increase to 70m, so 120m for whole system. Liftoff mass ~5000 mT.
1239031946962808832 2020-03-15 03:33:30 UTC <elonmusk> Fear is the mind-killer
1239024200708308999 2020-03-15 03:02:44 UTC <elonmusk> Congratulations Giga NY team!
